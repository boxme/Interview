For the first round of the competition, there will be 128/2 = 64 matches.
Follow by 64/2 = 32, then 32/2 = 16, 16/2 = 8, 8/2 = 4, 4/2 = 2, & finally, 2 / 2 = 1.

Hence, you need 64+32+16+8+4+2+1 = 127 matches to determine the best player out of 128 players.

If you need to find out the 2nd best player, then you need to get all the players who have lost directly to the
best player to compete amongst each other. Then the winner will be the second best.

The best player beat a total of 7 players in total. So you will need a total of 6 matches to find the best amongst 
them. Hence, 127 + 6 = 133 matches in total
